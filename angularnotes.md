As you can see here weâ€™re using the factory method RouterModule.forRoot to handover our routing configuration.


Behaviour subjects. I wrote a blog about that.

import { BehaviorSubject } from 'rxjs/BehaviorSubject';
private noId = new BehaviorSubject<number>(0);
  defaultId = this.noId.asObservable();

newId(urlId) {
 this.noId.next(urlId);
 }
In this example i am declaring a noid behavior subject of type number. Also it is an observable. And if "something happend" this will change with the new(){} function.

So, in the sibling's components, one will call the function, to make the change, and the other one will be affected by that change, or vice-versa.

For example, I get the id from the URL and update the noid from the behavior subject.

public getId () {
  const id = +this.route.snapshot.paramMap.get('id');
  return id;
}

ngOnInit(): void {
 const id = +this.getId ();
 this.taskService.newId(id)
}
And from the other side, I can ask if that ID is "what ever i want" and make a choice after that, in my case if i want to delte a task, and that task is the current url, it have to redirect me to the home:

delete(task: Task): void {
  //we save the id , cuz after the delete function, we  gonna lose it
  const oldId = task.id;
  this.taskService.deleteTask(task)
      .subscribe(task => { //we call the defaultId function from task.service.
        this.taskService.defaultId //here we are subscribed to the urlId, which give us the id from the view task
                 .subscribe(urlId => {
            this.urlId = urlId ;
                  if (oldId == urlId ) {
                // Location.call('/home');
                this.router.navigate(['/home']);
              }
          })
    })
}
